Our pharmacy website is designed to help pharmacy employees manage their prescriptions and associated
data. There are three types of users, assistants, pharmacists and managers. Once a user logs in, they will be
taken to the employee home page associated with their job type. The login is a secure entry point which
prevents SQL injections. Once on their home page, assistants can enter, edit and delete patient, doctor,
delivery and appointment information, as well as enter prescriptions. Pharmacists can edit and verify the
prescriptions the assistants have entered and enter, edit and delete follow-ups and vaccine records. The
manager has the power to enter, edit and delete inventory items, which include medications and vaccines.
They can also view all employee information, which is hidden from other user types.
